# Mapping Resilience: Emergency Centers Planning for Low-Income Communities Facing Extreme Weather Events

## Overview
This project was developed during a hackathon focused on climate change and extreme weather, examining how these phenomena impact communities. Our goal was to create interactive visualizations that reveal correlations between extreme weather risks and community vulnerabilities, ultimately pinpointing optimal emergency shelter locations in King County.

## Project Details
In this project, we analyzed five multi-layered data sets, which include:

- **Socioeconomic and Environmental Risk Factors**: Understanding the demographic and environmental context of communities.
- **Temperature Data**: Serving as an indicator for heatwaves.
- **Gauge Levels and Elevation**: Indicators for flooding risk.
- **Insurance Claims**: Reflecting the consequences of extreme weather events.
- **Data of Low-Income Communities**: Highlighting areas that are most vulnerable to extreme weather.

We mapped these data sets separately and in conjunction using Tableau, allowing us to visualize the most at-risk areas in need of emergency shelter.

## Team Members
Our team, "Climate Jays," consists of the following members:
